LipNet is a deep learning model designed for lip-reading, which involves recognizing speech by analyzing visual information from the movement of the lips. The primary objective of LipNet is to improve the accuracy of automatic speech recognition systems, particularly in noisy environments where traditional audio-based recognition may struggle. LipNet uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to process and interpret sequences of video frames showing a person's lips as they speak.
